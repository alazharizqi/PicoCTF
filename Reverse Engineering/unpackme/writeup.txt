- Description :
Can you get the flag?
Reverse engineer this Python program.

My solution :
first download the program.
at the code, i notice 2 variable payload and key_str.
i try to decode string from key_str by using base64 decode but still not found the flag.
then i try again to decode the payload and the result has same.
and then i notice at the line 11, plain variable decrypt the payload.
so i try to print plain and get the message b"\npw = input('What\\'s the password? ')\n\nif pw == 'batteryhorse':\n  print('picoCTF{175_chr157m45_cd82f94c}')\nelse:\n  print('That password is incorrect.')\n\n"
so at the message there is if statement which check condition the pw is true, then the flag will be print.
