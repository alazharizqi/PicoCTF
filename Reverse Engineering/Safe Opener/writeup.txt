Can you open this safe?
I forgot the key to my safe but this program is supposed to help me with retrieving the lost key. Can you help me unlock my safe?
Put the password you recover into the picoCTF flag format like:
picoCTF{password}

- My solution :

echo "picoCTF{$(echo 'cGwzYXMzX2wzdF9tM18xbnQwX3RoM19zYWYz' | base64 -d)}"

first download safe opener java file.
then read the code.
first i looking for base64 encoder.
and then i notice the string encoded.
so i search in google base 64 decode and paste the string encoded.
and then i get the message pl3as3_l3t_m3_1nt0_th3_saf3.
