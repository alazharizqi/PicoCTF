- Description :
Can you get the flag?
Run this Python program in the same directory as this encrypted flag.

- My solution :
first download python program and encrypted flag.
at the code, there is condition if( user_pw == "ak98" + \
                   "-=90" + \
                   "adfjhgj321" + \
                   "sleuth9000"):
copy all the string at if statement ak98-=90adfjhgj321sleuth9000
then run the program in terminal python patchme.flag.py -d flag.txt.enc
input password as string above
and then you get the flag.
