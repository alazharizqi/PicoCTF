Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and 
the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. 
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

- My solution
Data that i know the website location in usr/share/nginx/html/ and flag is flag.txt.
so i try add domain http://saturn.picoctf.net:52683/flag.txt and result is 500 internal server error.
and i realized to try to input by flag.txt form in website.
then i add ../flag.txt and still the same.
until ../../../../flag.txt finally i got the flag.
