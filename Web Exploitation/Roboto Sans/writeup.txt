- Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.
Check this out.

- My solution
add domain /robots.txt
there is text base64.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg

so i try to decode text above with base64 decoder.
the result is flag1.txtjs/myfif2זfRG@,z谖/u%z8
i guess the domain between txtjs/myfile.txt, myfile/js.txt, and js/myfile.txt.
then the flag will appear at domain js/myfile.txt
