We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?
The website is running here.

- My solution
first at the website i inspect the element then looking for link href css.
there is link href css.
so i try to add domain /secret/.
new page website has appear, then i inspect element again.
at link href css there is hidden/file.css, then i add domain to hidden/.
new page website has appear again, then i inspect element again.
there is link href css superhidden/login.css, then i add domain again to superhidden/.
finally the flag has been appear with white font or there is in inspect element.
