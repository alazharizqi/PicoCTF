then the result

CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice. For this problem, the flag is: picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_7AA384BC}

i try to submit the flag but the flag still incorrect.
then i assume the flag there is typo in J.
so i change to Q and submit again then it work.
